# IDR
Interactive Delphi Reconstructor (Pascal version)

This is a translation of the original C++ code (can be found on https://github.com/crypto2011/IDR) into Pascal.
Use Delphi 7 to build the project.
There is also a simple tool **IDP2TXT** which may be used to convert an IDP (IDR project file) to its textual representation.
